## Page Width and Wide Views
> [css snippet here](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-css-layout/blob/main/page%20width%20and%20wide%20views.css)

This snippet allow you to use cssclasses to enable either wide views - either wide-page, wide-dataview, wide-table or combination of those. For this snippet to works, you will need to disable "Readable line length" in `Settings > Editor`.

For wide-dataview and wide-table, you will need to install [Contextual Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-contextual-typography) plugin.
