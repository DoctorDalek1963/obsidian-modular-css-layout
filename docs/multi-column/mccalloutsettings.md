## Multi Column Callout Column Settings

#### Minimum Sub-Callout Width
set the minimum width for the callout inside [!multi-column] callout

#### Sub-Callout Gap
Add gap between the callout within [!multi-column] callout. It affects only the in-between gaps

#### Sub-Callout Margin
Add margin (external spacing) to callout within [!multi-column] callout to allow for box-shadow effects. If your theme doesn't use box-shadow for callout, you can safely set to 0.

#### Floating Callout Width (Small/Medium/Large)
Set the exact width of the side/floating callout (i.e. callout defined using callout-metadata e.g. [alert|right-medium]). `-small` Floating Callout size is independent from `-medium` and so on.
