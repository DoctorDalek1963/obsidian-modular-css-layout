## General linear model

> Example of [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression "Simple linear regression"), which has one independent variable

The **general linear model** or **general multivariate regression model** is a compact way of simultaneously writing several [multiple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_linear_regression "Multiple linear regression") models. In that sense it is not a separate statistical [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model "Linear model"). The various multiple linear regression models may be compactly written as $Y=XB + U$

The general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models: ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, ordinary linear regression, _t_-test and _F_-test. The general linear model is a generalization of multiple linear regression to the case of more than one dependent variable. If **Y**, **B**, and **U** were column vectors, the matrix equation above would represent multiple linear regression.

Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: multivariate or as several independent univariate tests. In multivariate tests the columns of **Y** are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of **Y** are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix.
