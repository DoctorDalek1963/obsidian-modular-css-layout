## There are two ways you can install the CSS snippets
To use, download or copy the css into your [vault]/.obsidian/snippets folder and enable them in Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets. Since I'm planning to update this snippets from time to time, you can use Mara Li's Snippet Downloader plugin to use Obsidian interface to download and update the snippets (when update is available).

### The normal user way
`via Mara Li's Snippet Downloader plugin`
> Please ensure your vault's /.obsidian/snippets folder is already created before doing the following steps. You can do that by going to `Settings > Appearance` and click "Open snippets folder" under CSS snippets section

- In Obsidian, go to `Settings > Community Plugins > Browse` and search for Snippet Downloader by Mara-Li
- Install and enable the plugin
- Open Command Pallete (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`), select Snippet Downloader: Add new snippet
- In the Repo Link area paste the following link `https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout`
